FIX USER PERSISTANTS!!!!!

-Decks
    -Check if signed in
    -Show how many cards are due for each deck 
    -Make reactmodel look better, make the background color the theme black color
    -Make a loading aimation for both loading the decks, and the reactmodel, because theres a delay before reactmodal opens
    -Make it so it doenst prompt unfinished deck each time component mouunts, after the first time, could just put a little box on the near bottom-right corner or top right or soemting


-Signin
    - Make it so you can press the signin by pressing enter


-DeckCreation
    
    -Make a cancel button
    
    -Make a pages feature so its not loading 1000 decks or something,
     like only load 10 per page, then user can switch to next page
        -Could make a sort feature or a search featrue
    -If you add a card, and its the longest text, it shifts the whole flex div over

-Cards
    -When deck is finished, make it not an alert
    -Add implementation for # of new decks per day. Could just add the # in a field in user or soemthing, unless it were different per deck.

-DeckEditation

    

Add lazy loading whereever needed, like loading screens for firebase loading
    -Cards
    -DeckEditation
    -Decks

OR I could make it so it looks like it instabtly delete whatever or changed something but it took a little longer in reatly to change it on firebase, What I did for /decks
