Notes - for buttons that seem to be autonmatically clicked use:

<button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Click</button>
is the solution. When you put paranthesis without using the arrow function, it will automatically execute without waiting for you to click the button



Signup:
    - Add email verification (maybe)

Signin:
    - Test forgot password more extensively
    -redo the whole loading state, because its definaetly not a good way
    - get all possible sign in errors and toast error them, unless better way


Drawer:
    - Test drawer, though I think it works


Decks:
    - Show how many cards are due for each deck
    - Add individual deck settings (number of cards per day)
    - Pagination
    - Search function - I dont think I really need
    - Delete Button doesnt work immedietly

DeckEditation:
    - Add isnew functionality
    - While editing a card, then press edit on another card, you can have both edits open at same time
    - buggy react query -> rethink things with state and react query -> useReducer as a possibility
    - Unable to delete card if is only card left, or maybe if its index of 0, unsure
    - change ui so that you can fit more cards or something
    - Is there a delete deck feature? if not built it and make sure to warn users beforehand

DeckCreation:
    - could add a check to see if already deck with name
    - Make sure user cant put in 3 trillion cards or whatever
    - When cancel button is pressed, delete the deck in database, and warn user just in case it was accident (are you sure? this will perminanrly delete the deck)

Cards:
    -rethink whole cardindex thing because it dosnt change if I delete cards before it for examle
    - add isNew functioanlity
    - Add to algo so that a card to be reviewed is added at 12:00 AM instead of the specific 7 days after for example
    - Extensive Testing
    - Make sure that when reviewing a deck, the new cards are shown every once in a while, for example, like after 10% of the reviewed cards are revieed. It should chagne with the number of new cards to be learned.
    - Pageination
    - Search function
    - Says no Cards due on first load, change to loading

ButtonComp:

react-hook-form:
    data.email
    data.password
    insetad of stringifying it


Profile:


App:
    - Add a check to see if on mobile device and suggest or prevent user from not using website then. Add "app not made for mobile devices disclamer" or someting
    - Fix auth - I think it has to do with authProvider and the fact that we arent initializing the app where we declare like auth persistance - can try react-firebase-hooks again
    - Add toast errors errwhere
    - WHen deleting something for user, just remove it from dom immeditatly
    - Caching data - REACT QUERY!!
    - UI errors here and there, such is on sign in and inspect elemnet is open



Production vs Development
    - Signin cookies.js -> uncomment process.env and comment out import
